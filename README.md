## HTTP/3 Adpative Server Push Running Command
Make sure python 3.8 is installed and all the requirments for aioquic (https://github.com/aiortc/aioquic) are installed. Run the below command in your cmd.

$ python examples/http3_server.py --certificate tests/ssl_cert.pem --private-key tests/ssl_key.pem
```

For testing client we need to open https://localhost:4433 whith few flags set. The command for it is follows

```
$ chromium \
    --enable-experimental-web-platform-features \
    --ignore-certificate-errors-spki-list=BSQJ0jkQ7wwhR7KvPZ+DSNk2XTZ/MS6xCbo9qu++VdQ= \
    --origin-to-force-quic-on=localhost:4433 \
    https://localhost:4433/
```
